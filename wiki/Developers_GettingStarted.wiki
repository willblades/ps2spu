= General Philosophy =

The basic idea behind this project is to create a Playstation2 SPU2 emulator that not only works on a wide variety of platforms, but that also is code in a consistent, readable and well-documented fashion that serves as documentation for the hardware as well.


= Design Details =

The project, while programmed in C++, is mostly composed of C code for performance reasons.  While C++ provides many unique tools, most of them were not right for this project.  The code is organized as follows

  * namespace ps2spu
    * namespace memory
    * namespace registers
    * namespace mixer
    * namespace audio
