# Current Status #

Right now the project is pre-release, but is developing quickly. For now the near-term goals are:

  * Logging and customized assertions for debugging
  * Simple SPU2 memory interface (read, write, dma, init, shutdown)
  * Determine what registers are present and useful and add them to registers.hpp
  * Use the SPU2null written by linuzappz and shadow, to allow basic emulation.  This plugin can be found in the PCSX2 subversion or on http://www.pcsx2.net.
